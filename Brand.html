    <p>The concept of the brand is a Health and Wellness company - A company dedicated providing products the boost the best from within people.</p>
    
    <p>The fonts I am using are Verdana for a majority of the text as it is minimalistic and easy on the eyes, and Tahoma headers and anything I want in a larger and bolder font as it is a bit more eye cathing while still being a simple and easy to read font.</p>
    
    <p>As for colors I am using Crayola's Lemon Yellow (255, 255, 159) for the background, red sepia black (44,4,2) for the text, and brandy punch orange (207,127,38). The colors are combinde with the intent to create a warm and inviting invornment for the eyes to be drawn to and nto cause strain.</p>
    
    <p id="mission">The mission of YellowLoss is to provide anyone with products to boost ones health in wellness in day to day life.</p>
