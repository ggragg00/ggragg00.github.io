<p> Personal Background: I moved around a lot as a kid because my mom was in the navy, but we eventually settled here in Charlotte because of my dad's job.

</p>
<p> Academic Background: I am a high school graduate and am currently working towards my associates here at CPCC.</p>
<p> Background in this subject: My mom has worked in IT my entire life, so I have been around computers and technology for a while. Though, she did not teach me coding as that was a hobby I picked up myself. </p>
